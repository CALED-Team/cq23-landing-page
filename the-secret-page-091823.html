<h1>Congratulations! Have another problem:</h1>

Melissa is the head of defense for code quest 23. She has the following materials available:
<ul>
    <li>6 tonnes of steel</li>
    <li>21 tonnes of wood</li>
    <li>2 tonnes of rubber</li>
</ul>
Don't ask how we got this, Grok is a very resourceful sponsor :)

From this, Melissa can make the following:

<ul>
    <li>A tank - requires 7 kg of wood (low tech)</li>
    <li>A helicopter - requires 12 kg of steel</li>
    <li>A control centre - requires 4kg of steel, 7kg of wood, 2kg of rubber</li>
</ul>

Luckily, the manufacturers are doing a few deals:
<ul>
    <li>Whenever a tank is produced, Melissa gets 1 free kg of steel, and 1kg of rubber</li>
    <li>Whenever a helicopter is produced, Melissa gets 1 free kg of wood, and 1 kg of rubber</li>
</ul>

The aim of all this construction is for Melissa to create jobs for the code quest underlings.

<ul>
    <li>Tanks create 3 new jobs</li>
    <li>Helicopters create 1 new job</li>
    <li>Control Centres create 4 new jobs</li>
</ul>

You can make a bulk order to the manufacturer and as long as at the end of the order you don't have negative materials everything is ok.
How many tanks, helicopters, and control centres should Melissa order to maximise jobs created?<br><br>

Message the side-challenges discord with your solution EG: "Melissa should make 100 tanks, 42 helicopters and 400 control centres"
