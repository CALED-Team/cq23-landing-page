                <p>
                    Every year we create a new game that no one has seen before.
                    All you need to do is to play this game and beat everyone
                    else! But wait… here's the catch. You can't play the game
                    yourself! You have to write a program to play the game with
                    your strategies on your behalf! The teams with the best
                    programs will win prizes at the end!

                                Knowing only the basics of programming
                                (input/output, lists, etc.) is enough for you to
                                have your program play the game. But of course
                                the more you know the more advanced your player
                                can be. Even if you can't fully articulate your
                                ideas for a program, the team based nature of
                                the competition allows you to tackle this
                                together with your peers, meaning you can bounce
                                ideas and work towards the bot you envisioned

                                Then the teams will have a week to work on their
                                programs (no need to go on campus in this time)
                                and then we will run the final games and give
                                prizes on the last day which is 24th of April.
                                We are going to run everything in Monash

                                more fun to have one and, also, we have designed
                                the game in a way that different people could
                                work on different parts of their program at the
                                same time. So if you do have a team you'll
                                definitely have a lot of advantage. We accept
                                teams of 1 to 3.
