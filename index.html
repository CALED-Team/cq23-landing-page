            <h2>What is CodeQuest?</h2>
            <p>
                Every year we create a new game that no one has seen before. All
                you need to do is to play this game and beat everyone else! But
                waitâ€¦ here's the catch. You can't play the game yourself! You
                have to write a program to play the game with your strategies on
                your behalf! The teams with the best programs will win prizes at
                the end!
